# ioioio - Docker Container Monitor

ioioio is a lightweight terminal-based Docker container monitoring tool that provides a simple, intuitive interface for managing and monitoring Docker containers. It allows you to view container status, logs, and perform basic container operations all from a single terminal window.

## Features

- **Real-time container monitoring**: View the status of all your Docker containers with automatic updates
- **Container grouping**: Containers are organized by project (based on Docker Compose labels) for better organization
- **Live log streaming**: Watch container logs in real-time
- **Container management**: Restart, stop, and start containers directly from the interface
- **Visual status indicators**: Colorful status indicators (🟢🔴🟡🟣🔵) show container states at a glance
